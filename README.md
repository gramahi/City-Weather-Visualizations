# City Weather Visualizations through API requests

In this porject, our primary objective is simple, we will create a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. The data models that will be displayed are a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

# Utilized Libraries and Data retrieved to accomplish the goal are:

    1) Citipy, a python Library

    2) OpenWeatherMap API
