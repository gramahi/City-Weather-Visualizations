# City Weather Visualizations through API requests

In this porject, our primary objective is simple, we will create a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. The data models that will be displayed are a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

# Required tools, Python Libraries:  
    
    1) Citipy, a python Library

    2) OpenWeatherMap API 
    
# Data-retrieved-Processes and Analyzed: 
    
    1) Python API-Interactions. API-Requests are intiated via API-Request from Weather Map API.
    
    2) Constuct a technical understanding of the Data Set
    
    3) Process the Data through performing necessary calculations. Thereafter Extract and Load the Data
    
    4) Model and perfrom the neccessary visualizations through Matplotlib to conclude the Analysis
